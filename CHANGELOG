libhyphenate-cfstring version 1:
- Heavy modifications for performance on iPhone OS, including changing the native string usage to CFString from std::string.

libhyphenate version 1.1.0: 
- Normalizing strings to lowercase now using glib's UTF-8 support to help
  matching non-ASCII characters.
- Hyphens are now placed by an HyphenationRule class to facilitate
  non-standard hyphenation.
- Non-standard hyphenation (like in old german: Schiffahrt => Schiff-fahrt,
  hungarian asszonnyal => asz-szony-nyal) is supported now.
